🐍🎲 Snake and Ladder Game (Python)

A simple two-player Snake and Ladder game built using Python and Pygame, demonstrating game logic, conditional handling, and basic GUI programming.

📌 Project Overview

This project is a digital implementation of the classic Snake and Ladder board game.
Players roll a dice, move across the board, climb ladders, slide down snakes, and compete to reach the final square first.
The main goal of this project is to convert real-world game rules into Python logic using clean and understandable code.

🎯 Problem Statement :

Traditional Snakes and Ladders is a physical board game.
The challenge was to simulate the same gameplay digitally, including:
Dice rolling
Player turns
Board movement
Snake and ladder conditions
Win detection

🛠️ Technologies Used :

Python
Pygame (for graphics and event handling)
Random module (for dice simulation)

✨ Features

Two-player gameplay
Dice roll using random numbers (1–6)
Turn-based movement
Snakes and Ladders implemented using logic
Graphical board display
Win condition detection
Keyboard interaction

🧠 Game Logic (High-Level) :

Players start from position 0
Dice value determines player movement
If a player lands on:
Ladder → moves up
Snake → moves down
Rolling a 6 gives an extra turn
The first player to reach position 100 wins the game

▶️ How to Run the Project 
1️⃣ Install Pygame
pip install pygame

2️⃣ Run the game
python snake_and_ladder.py
